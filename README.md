# Final Examination: Digital Devices Project

This is one of the three project for BSc thesis at **Politecnico di Milano**.  
The related course for this project is _"Reti Logiche"_ (aka Digital Devices).

Aim of this project was to realize a **VHDL implementation** of a Working-zone encoding method for **FPGA devices**.  
See specification here: [Specification document](https://github.com/a-alto/Working-zone_encoding_with_FPGA/blob/main/Specifiche/PFRL_Specifica_1920.pdf) (italian only).

My implementation is more focused on performance and speed rather than low space consumption.  
See more on my [documentation](https://github.com/a-alto/Working-zone_encoding_with_FPGA/blob/main/Documentazione/LaTeX/documentazione.pdf) (italian only).
